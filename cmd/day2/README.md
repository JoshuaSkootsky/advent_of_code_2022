## Notes for Day 2

- Elves like snacks this year.
- Note the problem refers to the plural as elves, not elfs.

- The word 'encrypted' in the question threw me off, I thought I'd need to decrypt something before I finished reading

- I also thought I might need to randomly simulate the strategy guide against random inputs.

- The first question is how to quickly add up one round, then repeat that process.

- Had a great moment with Embed where the compiler caught `//go:embed input_day2.txt` instead of `//go:embed input_day02.txt`. That's really cool.
