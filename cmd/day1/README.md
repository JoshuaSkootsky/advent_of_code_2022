## Comments for Day 1

My first thought was to use a heap or to just keep track of the maximum.

It turns out to be more more but also more straightforward and extensible to solve the problem by sorting all the elves.

It's interesting that in a real situation, each elf would have a name or a UUID, and we'd want to keep track of which elf or elves have the most calories on them so that we could find them.

We'd also want to know how to match up the results of the query which elf or elves have the most calories to their original order.

I imagine a line of elves marching through the polar environs, looking for elf #177 who has the most snack bars.
